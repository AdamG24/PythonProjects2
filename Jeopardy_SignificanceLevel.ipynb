    "I wanted to see the matches between the answer and question columns to see how valuable studying past answers would help in answering future questions correctly. This match_count function is to see overlap. In creating this function, I defined new variables of split_answer (splitting every word of every answer row) and split_question (spkitting every word in the question row). From their I created an if statement that would eliminate the word 'the'if found in the answer values. I then created a separate if that determine if the answer column equaled 0. If so, that new row column would present a 0 value. Now that text is separated and certain values were represented as numerical, its now time to create a new match_count variable that we can instiate over with a for loop. We defined item as any text/word within the split_answer rows. If that same item that is in split answer and in split question, we add one to the match_count variable. By assigning += to the variable, that. means we add one to the preexisting value every time a match occurs. Last element of the function is dividing the match_count by the length of the split_answer, which helps determine the percentahe of words that match from the question to the answer. "

Within the for loop, I want to define my split_question variable, which at first will be the question_clean row values, split by a space. I will add to the split_question and continue to define the variable by only accepting question with greater than 5 characters. As before, I define the match_count variable as 0 to start and will instatiate values into the variable as values match. I begin the for loop with searching for words within split_question to iterate over. If specific words from that row are within the terms_used set, then the match_count varaible is added by 1. This process continues as it is iterated over the whole dataset rows, meaning the match_count variable will grow as more matches are found. Within the larger first for loop, I created another for loop to iterated words over the split_question column to add words that are seen as we iterate over the question to the terms_used set. A set will eliminate duplicates. Last element of the for loop will be an if statement that staes if the length of the characters within a specific word of the split_question is greater than 0, we will continue to divide the match_count (that can be constabntly growing) by the len of the words characters.
